## Welcome to raspberry pico sensors repository
This repository contains a collection of basic sensor measurements with MicroPython code and connection setup. The measurements are done with Raspberry Pico (WH) board. The code is written in MicroPython. The measurements can be saved into a file and can be visualized with the help of Jupyter notebook or some other tool.

## Requirements
1. Raspberry Pico (W) board
2. Sensor

### Projects (table)
| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Flex](/raspberry_pico_sensors/flex/README.md) | This setup uses flex sensor (Flex Sensor 2.2) to measure the flex. |
| [Motion vibration](/raspberry_pico_sensors/motion_vibration/README.md) | This project uses vibration sensor (SW1801P/LM393) to measure the vibration. |
| [Strain gauge](/raspberry_pico_sensors/strain_gauge/README.md) | This setup uses strain gauge sensor (BF350-3AA/1.5AA) to measure the strain. |
| [EKG heartbeat](/raspberry_pico_sensors/ekg_heartbeat/README.md) | This setup uses heart beat sensor (AD8232) to measure the heart beat rate. |
| [Heartbeat](/raspberry_pico_sensors/heart_beat/README.md) | This setup uses heart beat sensor (XD-58C) to measure the heart beat rate. |
