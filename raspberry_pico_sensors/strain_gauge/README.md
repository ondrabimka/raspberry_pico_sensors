# Welcome to strain gauge sensor measurement
This repository contains the code for the strain gauge project. This project uses strain gauge sensor to measure the strain.

## Requirements
1. Arduino Pico
2. Strain gauge sensor (BF350-3AA/1.5AA)

## How to use
1. Connect the sensor to the Arduino board as shown in the figure below.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
3. Attach the sensor to the object you want to measure the strain.
