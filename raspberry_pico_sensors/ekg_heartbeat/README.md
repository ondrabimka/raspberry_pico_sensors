# Welcome to ekg_heartbeat sensor measurement
This repository contains the code for the ekg_heartbeat project. This project uses heart beat sensor to measure the heart beat rate and save it into "ekg_data.txt" file. Some measurements can be found in the "exploration/ekg_data.txt" file.

## Requirements
1. Arduino Pico
2. EKG sensor (AD8232)

## How to use
1. Connect the sensor to the Arduino board as shown in the figure below.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
3. TBD: schema how to attach sensors to your body.
